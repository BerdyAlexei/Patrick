## FAQ

- #### Is this a virus?
No, but *it can be detected as one in the form of a false positive*: It's a bit my fault, I've had problems with *PyInstaller* (The tool with which you convert *Python* code into an executable) and when I create a program that happens, but I'm not the only one, here is some information that may help you understand:
